Instructions:
	* Open the colab notebook locally or in google colab
	* If running on google colab, mount google drive and set the path of the Wildtrack dataset
	* If running locally only set the path to the Wildtrack dataset
        * To run all the tasks together, just select the run all cells option from the runtime menu or simply press ctrl + F9 
		- this will work if you are using google colab
		- if running locally, comment out the cell which mounts the google drive, and then it should work
        * The tasks can also be executed seperately. For that run each cell in order

Note: All these instruction are also availble in the colab notebook.
